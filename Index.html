    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Status Saver. This Privacy Policy explains how Status Saver ("we", "our", or "the App") developed by Yuvraj Singh handles information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

        <li>Content of your WhatsApp messages or chats</li>

    <h3>2.3 Information You Provide</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected through Status Saver and its integrated services is used for the following purposes:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your information seriously. Status Saver implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the limited data processed by the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Most app features, including status saving, font generation, and app lock, are processed locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>No Central Database:</strong> We do not maintain a central database of user information or saved statuses</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric Security:</strong> Biometric authentication data (fingerprint/face) is handled exclusively by your device's operating system and is never accessed, stored, or transmitted by Status Saver</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Connections:</strong> Communications with Firebase and AdMob services use encrypted connections</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Data Collection:</strong> By design, we minimize data collection to only what is necessary for app functionality and improvement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, please note that no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Status Saver integrates several third-party services that may collect and process information according to their own privacy policies:</p>

    <h3>5.1 AdMob (Google)</h3>
    <p>Status Saver displays advertisements through Google AdMob, which may show banner ads, interstitial ads, and app open ads. AdMob may collect and use your advertising identifier and related information to provide personalized advertisements. You can learn more about how Google uses data at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>5.2 Firebase Services (Google)</h3>
    <p>We use the following Firebase services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous usage data to help us understand app performance and user behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Collects crash reports and diagnostic information to improve app stability</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging:</strong> Enables push notifications for app updates and announcements</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase In-App Updates:</strong> Facilitates app update notifications and installations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firebase services are governed by Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>5.3 Google Play Services</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google Play Services for various functionalities. Google Play Services may collect information as described in Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>5.4 WhatsApp</h3>
    <p>Status Saver interacts with WhatsApp to access publicly visible statuses stored on your device and to facilitate direct messaging. We do not access your WhatsApp account, messages, or any information beyond what is stored locally on your device. Your use of WhatsApp is subject to WhatsApp's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand their data practices.</p>

    <h2>6. Storage Access Permissions</h2>
    <p>Status Saver requires storage permissions to function properly. Here's why we need these permissions and how we use them:</p>

    <h3>6.1 READ Storage Permission</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To access and display WhatsApp statuses saved on your device</li>
        <li>To show your saved statuses in the built-in gallery viewer</li>
        <li>To read media files for status saving and management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 WRITE Storage Permission</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To save WhatsApp status images, videos, and GIFs to your device</li>
        <li>To organize and manage saved statuses in dedicated folders</li>
        <li>To enable file management features for saved content</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Status Saver only accesses WhatsApp status folders and the folders where saved statuses are stored. We do not access other personal files, documents, or folders on your device. All saved statuses remain on your device and under your control.</p>

    <h2>7. Biometric Permission</h2>
    <p>Status Saver offers an App Lock feature that uses biometric authentication (fingerprint or face unlock) to protect your privacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The biometric permission is used exclusively to enable the App Lock feature, which prevents unauthorized access to the App</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All biometric authentication is handled by your device's secure operating system. Status Saver does not access, store, or transmit your biometric data</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Feature:</strong> Using the App Lock feature is completely optional. You can use Status Saver without enabling this feature</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can enable or disable App Lock at any time within the App settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your biometric data remains secure on your device and is never shared with us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>8. Direct Message Feature</h2>
    <p>The Direct Message feature allows you to send WhatsApp messages to phone numbers without saving them as contacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> Status Saver does NOT store, save, or transmit the phone numbers or message text you enter in this feature</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> The phone number and message are processed locally on your device only to create a WhatsApp intent</li>
        <li><strong>Direct to WhatsApp:</strong> The information is passed directly to WhatsApp, and the actual message sending is handled by WhatsApp according to their privacy practices</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Communication:</strong> This feature does not communicate with any server or external service operated by us</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend that you do not share sensitive personal information through this or any messaging feature.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Status Saver is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Since we do not collect personal information in general, this further ensures compliance with children's privacy protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided information through the App, please contact us immediately at the email address provided below, and we will take appropriate steps to address the situation.</p>
    <p>Parents and guardians should supervise their children's use of mobile applications and ensure they understand appropriate online behavior and privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Consent</h2>

    </ul>
